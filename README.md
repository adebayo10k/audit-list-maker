Creating audit listings
===

**audit_list_maker** creates independently (on a separate device) stored 'reference listings' of the media files on a drive when the backup of those files is not justified.

**Use Case:**
We have a large collection of media files, stored on an external drive.
Even if we lost this content due to drive failure, accidental formatting (oops), physical damage etc, the process of reacquiring this content would be trivial, so we're not bothered about backing them up.
All we'd need in order to go about rebuilding would be an up to date listing of those media files.


**Getting creative** by solving problems.


That's the purpose of this project.
