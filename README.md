Creating audit listings
===

# audit_list_maker

Creates independently stored reference listings of media files on a drive when backup of those files is not justified.

So, for example if we have a large collection of media files, perhaps stored on an external drive. Even if we lost this
content due to drive failure, accidental formatting (oops), physical damage etc, reacquisition of this content would be trivial.
All we'd need in order to go about rebuilding would be a listing of the files.


**Getting creative** by solving problems.


That's the purpose of this project.
