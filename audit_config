# /etc/audit_config

# The directory paths specified here will determine how the program operates.
# Comments and empty lines are ignored as usual.
# THE FIRST LINE OF THIS CONFIGURATION FILE MUST BE A COMMENT

# destination_holding_dir_fullpath variable:
# This is the location, possibly on a separate storage device in which you want to store 
# these lists of media (or whatever) files. It is the directory in which all listing files will be created.
# This directory will NOT be created if it doesn't already exist.
# This should be a single file path relative to the root of your filesystem,
# (ie the full, absolute path with leading /). Only one single value can be assigned here.
